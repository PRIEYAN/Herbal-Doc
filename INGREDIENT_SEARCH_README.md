# Herbal Doc AI - E-commerce Product Search Feature

## Overview

The Herbal Doc AI app now includes a new feature that allows users to find products containing herbal ingredients on popular e-commerce platforms. When the AI suggests remedies containing ingredients like "honey", "ginger", "turmeric", etc., these ingredients become clickable and open a product search screen showing items from Amazon and Flipkart.

## Features

- Clickable ingredients are styled with a green background and underline
- Supports a comprehensive list of 200+ herbal ingredients and common food items

### 2. E-commerce Integration
- Searches for products on Amazon India and Flipkart
- Displays product listings with prices, ratings, and availability
- Direct links to product pages on both platforms
- Platform-specific branding and colors

### 3. Product Search
- Shows mock product data for testing
- Filters by platform (Amazon, Flipkart, or Both)
- Quick search buttons to open platform search pages
- Product cards with images, prices, and ratings

### 4. Product Details
- Displays product name, price, and rating
- Shows availability status
- Platform tags (Amazon/Flipkart)
- Clickable product cards that open platform URLs

### E-commerce Integration

The app integrates with popular Indian e-commerce platforms:

const amazonUrl = `https://www.amazon.in/s?k=${encodeURIComponent(ingredient)}`;

## Example AI Response

> "Here are some natural remedies for fever:
> 1. Drink **ginger** tea with **honey**
> 2. Take **turmeric** with warm **milk**

The words in bold would be clickable and open the product search screen.
